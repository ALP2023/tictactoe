### Step 1: Review the Existing Code

Firstly, analyze the given tic-tac-toe game code. Understand the flow and functionality before proceeding with the refactoring.

def win_conditions

Defines a list of tuples called win_conditions. Each tuple contains three indices representing the positions on the board forming a winning combination.  The loop then checks if any of these combinations are filled with the same player's symbol and not empty. If a win condition is found, it prints the winner and exits the game.

Issues: only considers if a player has filled three cells in a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol.
