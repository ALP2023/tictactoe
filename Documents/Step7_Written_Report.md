Once you have completed your refactoring, write a brief report addressing the following:

1. Justification for your refactoring decisions.


2. The challenges you would have faced maintaining and testing the original monolithic code.


3. How you would modify your refactored code to handle a custom-sized tic-tac-toe game (larger than 3x3), and how this implementation would be easier to handle than in the original code.
